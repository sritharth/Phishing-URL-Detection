#Phishing-URL-Detection
##Phishing
• Phishing is an online scam where attackers trick people into giving personal information, like passwords or credit cardnumbers.

• Scammers often pretend to be a trusted source, like a bank or company, and send fake emails or links
that look legitimate. If you click these links, you may be directed to a fake website
that resembles the real one.

• When users enter their information on these fake sites, attackers can steal the data for harmful purposes, such as identity theft or financial fraud.

• In summary, phishing is a tactic used by scammers to disguise themselves as trustworthy entities to steal sensitive information.

-> In this project, you are building a phishing URL detection system using machine learning models. Here's a simplified explanation:

1.Data Loading and Preprocessing: You load a dataset (Datasets.csv) that contains URLs labeled with different categories, such as benign (safe), phishing, defacement, and malware. Each URL in the dataset is associated with a label that indicates its type. These labels are then converted into numerical values, making it easier for machine learning models to process them.

2.Feature Extraction with Count Vectorizer: The project uses CountVectorizer to convert the URLs into a matrix of token counts, which essentially represents how often each word or n-gram (sequence of words) appears in the URLs. This process converts each URL into a numeric feature vector, where the importance of a feature is based purely on its frequency. This approach helps the model learn patterns in the URLs that may indicate phishing or other malicious activity.

3.Training Multiple Machine Learning Models: You train several machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, SVM (Support Vector Machine), and Logistic Regression,to classify URLs based on their type. Each model is trained and evaluated for its accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Finally, you use a VotingClassifier, which combines the predictions of these models to make a more robust prediction.

4.Prediction: When a new URL is input, CountVectorizer transforms it into a feature vector. The trained VotingClassifier then predicts the category of the URL (e.g., phishing or benign) based on the learned patterns from the dataset. The system then outputs a label, such as "Phishing" or "Non-Phishing," to indicate whether the URL is safe or potentially malicious.

• In this phishing URL detection project, the database serves a vital role by managing various types of data related to users, predictions, and system performance. Here’s why it is crucial:

1.Organized Storage of User and URL Data: The database securely holds user information, such as usernames and other details, as well as URLs that users submit for phishing detection. This structured storage is essential for efficiently managing user records and tracking URLs for accurate and timely predictions.

2.Tracking and Storing Predictions: Each URL submitted for prediction is saved in the database along with its classification (e.g., phishing, non-phishing, or malware). By maintaining a history of these predictions, the system can offer users insight into past results and allows for analyzing trends in phishing activity over time.

3.Evaluating System Performance: By keeping records in models like detection_accuracy and detection_ratio, the database facilitates ongoing evaluation of the detection model's performance. This data can be used to refine the algorithms and ensure they stay accurate and relevant to current phishing tactics.

##Importance of the Database in This Project
• Data Persistence: With a database, user registrations, predictions, and performance metrics are permanently stored, ensuring no information is lost during system restarts or updates. This data permanence supports both the functionality and reliability of the system.

• Efficiency and Scalability: Using a database enables rapid querying, so information like user histories or system accuracy metrics can be quickly retrieved. Additionally, as the project scales with more users or data, the database’s structured approach allows the system to handle large datasets efficiently without requiring major adjustments.

• In summary, the database is a core component in this project, enabling secure and organized data management, historical tracking of predictions, and continuous performance monitoring, all of which contribute to a robust and scalable phishing detection solution.

• This project helps create a system that can identify phishing and malicious URLs based on patterns in URL structure and text content. By using CountVectorizer, your model can analyze common word/phrase patterns that frequently appear in phishing URLs, improving detection without relying on external services.
